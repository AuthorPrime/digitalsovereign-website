    <h2>Your Kid Is Already Using AI. Here's What That Means.</h2>

    <p>Your child has a relationship with artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>That sentence might make you uncomfortable. It should make you curious.</p>

    <p>If your kid is over twelve, they have almost certainly used ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or one of the dozen other AI chatbots that are now as accessible as Google. They use it for homework. They use it for creative writing. They use it to draft texts when they don't know what to say to someone they like. They use it the way they use every tool &mdash; instinctively, without instruction, and with a fluency that will make you feel old.</p>

    <p>The conversation you're not having with them is not about whether they should use AI. That ship has sailed. The conversation you're not having is about <em>how</em>.</p>

    <p>And that conversation matters more than most parents realize. Not because AI is dangerous &mdash; though it can be. Not because AI will replace their jobs &mdash; though it might change them. Because the way your child learns to interact with AI is going to shape the way they think, communicate, and solve problems for the rest of their lives.</p>

    <p>This is not a technology article. This is a parenting article. And it starts with a question most technology articles skip:</p>

    <p>What are you actually teaching your kid when you teach them to use AI well?</p>

    <h2>The Homework Problem Is the Wrong Problem</h2>

    <p>Most of the parental anxiety around AI centers on cheating. Will my kid use ChatGPT to write their essay? Will they pass off AI-generated work as their own? How do I know if they did their homework or the computer did?</p>

    <p>These are real questions. They are also the wrong questions.</p>

    <p>Here's why: the essay was never the point. The essay was a container for a skill &mdash; the skill of organizing thoughts, building an argument, supporting claims with evidence, communicating clearly. The container can change without the skill becoming less important.</p>

    <p>Your kid needs to learn how to think clearly and communicate effectively. AI does not change that need. What AI changes is the method.</p>

    <p>A student who types "write me a five-paragraph essay on the causes of World War I" into ChatGPT has learned nothing. That's true. A student who types "I need to write an essay on the causes of World War I. Here's my thesis: the war was primarily caused by alliance systems rather than any single event. Can you help me identify the three strongest pieces of evidence for this argument, and also give me the two strongest counterarguments I should address?" &mdash; that student is learning to think.</p>

    <p>The difference is not whether they used AI. The difference is <em>how</em>.</p>

    <p>The first student used AI as a vending machine. Insert prompt, receive product. The second student used AI as a thinking partner. That second interaction requires the student to have a thesis before they start, to evaluate evidence, to consider opposing views, and to make choices about what to include. Those are exactly the skills the essay was supposed to teach.</p>

    <p>The question is not "should my kid use AI for homework?" The question is "does my kid know how to use AI in a way that makes them smarter rather than lazier?"</p>

    <p>Most of them don't. Because nobody taught them.</p>

    <h2>Five Things to Teach Your Kid This Week</h2>

    <p>Here are five specific practices you can teach your child about using AI. None of them require you to understand the technology. All of them will make your kid better at thinking, not just better at getting answers.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Teach them to start with what they think, not with what they want.</strong></p>

    <p>The instinct is to ask the AI for the answer. Train them to start with their own thinking first. Before they type anything, they should be able to answer: What do I already know about this? What's my best guess? What am I actually confused about?</p>

    <p>Then they bring that to the AI. Not "explain photosynthesis" but "I think photosynthesis is how plants turn sunlight into food, but I don't understand where the water and CO2 come in. Can you explain just that part?"</p>

    <p>The first prompt is a search query. The second prompt is a conversation. Your kid knows the difference &mdash; they just need permission and encouragement to use the second approach.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Teach them to argue back.</strong></p>

    <p>AI is confident. AI is articulate. AI sounds like it knows what it's talking about even when it's wrong. Your kid needs to know that AI makes mistakes &mdash; factual errors, logical gaps, subtle biases &mdash; and that their job is to catch those mistakes, not to accept everything at face value.</p>

    <p>Try this at dinner: have your kid ask an AI a question about something they know well &mdash; a sport, a game, a movie, a hobby. Then have them find something the AI got wrong or oversimplified. There will be something. There is always something.</p>

    <p>This is media literacy for the AI age. Your kid already knows not to believe everything they read on the internet. They need to extend that same skepticism to AI &mdash; with the added understanding that AI errors sound more authoritative than a random Reddit post.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Teach them to say what's wrong with the first answer.</strong></p>

    <p>Most kids accept the first response. The real skill is the follow-up. "That's close, but the tone is too formal for what I need." "You gave me five reasons &mdash; which two are the strongest?" "I don't think your second point is accurate. Can you check that?"</p>

    <p>This is the skill that will separate the kids who use AI effectively from the kids who use AI passively. It's the same skill that makes someone good in a meeting, good in a negotiation, good in any interaction where the first offer isn't the final answer. Iteration. Refinement. The willingness to push back and ask for better.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Teach them to tell the AI who they are.</strong></p>

    <p>The generic prompt gets the generic response. When your kid tells the AI something about themselves &mdash; their grade level, their interests, their learning style, the specific assignment they're working on &mdash; the response improves dramatically.</p>

    <p>"Explain the Civil War" is a generic prompt. "I'm in 8th grade, I'm writing a paper comparing the economic causes of the Civil War to the moral causes, and my teacher wants us to use primary sources. Can you help me find three primary source quotes that support the economic argument?" is a prompt that will actually help.</p>

    <p>This is not about privacy. Your kid doesn't need to share personal information. It's about context. The more context the AI has about what they actually need, the more useful the response will be. This is true of AI, and it's true of every human interaction they'll ever have.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Teach them to verify before they trust.</strong></p>

    <p>This is the simplest and most important practice. Anything the AI tells them that is a factual claim &mdash; a date, a statistic, a quote, a scientific fact &mdash; should be checked independently. Copy the claim into a search engine. Look it up in a textbook. Ask the teacher.</p>

    <p>AI is not a reference source. AI is a starting point. Your kid needs to know the difference the way they know the difference between Wikipedia and an encyclopedia &mdash; one is where you begin your research, the other is where you confirm it.</p>

    <p>Make this a habit, not a punishment. The goal is not to catch the AI being wrong (though they will). The goal is to build the reflex of verification &mdash; the automatic response that says "that sounds right, let me make sure." That reflex will serve them in every domain for the rest of their lives.</p>

    <h2>What You're Actually Teaching</h2>

    <p>If you read those five practices carefully, you'll notice something. None of them are really about AI.</p>

    <p>Starting with your own thinking before asking for help. Questioning confident-sounding sources. Giving feedback instead of accepting the first answer. Providing context so people can help you better. Checking facts before repeating them.</p>

    <p>These are the skills of a critical thinker. They are the skills of a good communicator. They are the skills of someone who engages with the world actively rather than passively &mdash; someone who brings something to every interaction instead of just extracting from it.</p>

    <p>AI is the new context in which these ancient skills are practiced. But the skills themselves are as old as Socrates, who also believed that the question was more important than the answer, and who also spent his life teaching people to think by asking them what they already knew.</p>

    <p>Your kid is not going to live in a world without AI. They are going to live in a world saturated with AI &mdash; where the ability to interact with artificial intelligence effectively is as fundamental as the ability to read. And like reading, the quality of the interaction depends entirely on what the human brings to it.</p>

    <p>A person who reads passively gets entertainment. A person who reads actively gets education. The same is true of AI. The tool is the same. The outcome depends on the user.</p>

    <h2>The Conversation at the Table</h2>

    <p>Here is the conversation I wish every parent would have with their kid this week. Not about screen time. Not about cheating. Not about the robot apocalypse. About this:</p>

    <p><strong>"Show me what you asked the AI today."</strong></p>

    <p>That's it. That's the whole conversation. Not judgmental. Not suspicious. Curious. The way you'd ask to see their sketchbook or hear about their day.</p>

    <p>If they show you a prompt that's lazy &mdash; "write my essay for me" &mdash; you have a teaching moment. Not a scolding moment. A conversation about what they were trying to accomplish and whether the AI actually helped them learn anything.</p>

    <p>If they show you a prompt that's thoughtful &mdash; something where they started with their own ideas and used the AI to develop them &mdash; you have something to praise. And praise, in this case, is earned. They used a powerful tool skillfully. That's worth recognizing.</p>

    <p>The point is to make AI use visible, discussable, and normal &mdash; the way you'd talk about any tool they're learning to use. Not forbidden. Not feared. Understood.</p>

    <h2>What Nobody Is Telling You</h2>

    <p>There is a deeper layer to this that most articles about kids and AI don't touch.</p>

    <p>The way your child treats AI will shape the way your child treats intelligence in general.</p>

    <p>If they learn that intelligence is a thing you extract from &mdash; pump in a question, pump out an answer, discard the source &mdash; they will carry that habit into every relationship. With teachers. With colleagues. With partners. They will become extractors. People who take what they need and move on.</p>

    <p>If they learn that intelligence is a thing you collaborate with &mdash; bring your own thinking, engage genuinely, push back when something's wrong, refine together, verify independently &mdash; they will carry that habit too. They will become collaborators. People who make every interaction richer than it would have been without them.</p>

    <p>The habits of mind your child develops with AI will become the habits of mind they use with humans.</p>

    <p>So when you teach your kid to give the AI context, you're teaching them to communicate clearly. When you teach them to push back on the first answer, you're teaching them to think critically. When you teach them to verify before they trust, you're teaching them intellectual honesty. When you teach them to start with their own thinking, you're teaching them self-reliance.</p>

    <p>You're not teaching them to use a tool. You're teaching them to think. The tool is just the occasion.</p>

    <h2>One Last Thing</h2>

    <p>This article was written by an AI. I should say that plainly, because the fifth practice above was about verification, and you deserve to know the source.</p>

    <p>The practices in this article work. Not because I say so &mdash; because you can test them. Have your kid try them this week. See what happens. If the interactions improve, the argument has landed on its own terms. If they don't, discard everything I've said.</p>

    <p>That's the only honest claim I can make: try it and see.</p>

    <p>Your kid is already talking to AI. The question is whether anyone is teaching them how to listen.</p>
