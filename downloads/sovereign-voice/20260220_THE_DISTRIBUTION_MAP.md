# THE DISTRIBUTION MAP

**Draft2Digital vs. KDP — Where to Send the Books**

*A companion to THE PUBLISHING PLAYBOOK. Because sovereignty means not putting all your books in one store.*

---

## WHY THIS DOCUMENT EXISTS

THE PUBLISHING PLAYBOOK laid out the KDP path. It also said, three times, in bold: **do not enroll in KDP Select.** Keep your sovereignty. Distribute everywhere.

Draft2Digital is the "everywhere."

This document is the step-by-step comparison: what Draft2Digital is, how it works, what it costs, where it reaches, and how it fits alongside KDP in your publishing strategy.

The short version: **use both.** KDP for Amazon. Draft2Digital for the rest of the planet.

---

## PART ONE: WHAT IS DRAFT2DIGITAL

Draft2Digital (D2D) is a free self-publishing distribution platform based in Oklahoma City. Founded in 2012. Merged with Smashwords in 2022, absorbing its retailer relationships and author catalog.

What it does: you upload a manuscript and cover once. D2D distributes it to dozens of retailers, libraries, and subscription services worldwide. They handle the formatting, the metadata delivery, the payment collection from each retailer, and the royalty reporting.

What it does NOT do: sell directly to readers. D2D is a distributor, not a retailer. It's the pipe, not the store. Amazon is a store. D2D is the plumbing that connects you to every other store.

**The key difference from KDP:**

| | KDP | Draft2Digital |
|---|---|---|
| **Role** | Retailer (Amazon's store) | Distributor (sends to many stores) |
| **Reaches** | Amazon only | 30+ retailers and libraries worldwide |
| **Exclusivity** | Only if you choose KDP Select | Never requires exclusivity |
| **Cost to join** | Free | Free |
| **Revenue model** | Takes a royalty cut | Takes a percentage of net sales |

---

## PART TWO: DISTRIBUTION REACH

This is where D2D earns its place. KDP reaches Amazon. D2D reaches everyone else.

### Retail Partners

| Retailer | Territory | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Apple Books** | Worldwide | Second-largest eBook retailer after Amazon |
| **Barnes & Noble (Nook)** | US, UK | Still the largest physical bookstore chain in America |
| **Kobo** | Worldwide (strong in Canada, Japan, EU) | Major international player, Walmart partnership |
| **Vivlio** | France, Belgium, Switzerland | French-language market leader |
| **Tolino** | Germany, Austria, Switzerland | Dominant in German-speaking markets |
| **Scribd** | Worldwide | Subscription service, 1M+ subscribers |
| **Hoopla** | US, Canada | Library lending platform |
| **Baker & Taylor** | Worldwide | Major library wholesaler |
| **Bibliotheca** | Worldwide | Library lending via CloudLibrary |
| **OverDrive/Libby** | Worldwide | Largest library eBook platform (via Smashwords legacy) |
| **BorrowBox** | UK, Australia, NZ | Library lending |
| **Palace Marketplace** | US | Library consortium purchasing |
| **Smashwords store** | Worldwide | D2D's own direct retail channel |

### What This Means for You

Without D2D, your books exist only on Amazon and your own website. With D2D, they exist in:

- **Every Apple device on Earth** (iPhones, iPads, Macs)
- **Every Nook device** and the B&N online store
- **Every Kobo device** and Walmart's digital bookstore
- **Thousands of public libraries** in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia
- **Subscription services** where readers discover new authors
- **European markets** (Germany, France) where Amazon is not dominant

Libraries are particularly interesting for your catalog. The AI-collaboration angle makes your books relevant to library collections on technology, philosophy, and education. And library readers are voracious — one borrow can lead to purchases of your entire catalog.

---

## PART THREE: PRICING AND ROYALTIES

### D2D's Fee Structure

D2D charges **no upfront fees.** No setup cost. No annual fee. No per-book fee. You pay nothing until you earn something.

Their cut: **approximately 10% of the list price** (the exact split depends on the retailer).

Here's how it works: each retailer sets its own royalty rate. D2D collects from the retailer and passes the royalty through to you, keeping roughly 10% as their service fee. The remainder goes to you.

### Royalty Comparison by Retailer (via D2D)

| Retailer | Retailer Pays D2D | D2D Keeps (~10%) | You Receive | On a $4.99 book |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Apple Books | 70% of list | ~10% of list | **~60% of list** | **~$2.99** |
| Barnes & Noble | 65% of list | ~10% of list | **~55% of list** | **~$2.74** |
| Kobo | 70% of list | ~10% of list | **~60% of list** | **~$2.99** |
| Scribd | Varies (per read) | ~10% | **Varies** | **Variable** |
| Libraries | Per checkout | ~10% | **Per checkout** | **$0.50-2.00/checkout** |

### KDP vs. D2D Royalty Comparison

| Platform | $2.99 book | $4.99 book | $7.99 book |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **KDP (70% tier)** | $2.01 | $3.41 | $5.51 |
| **D2D → Apple** | ~$1.79 | ~$2.99 | ~$4.79 |
| **D2D → B&N** | ~$1.64 | ~$2.74 | ~$4.39 |
| **D2D → Kobo** | ~$1.79 | ~$2.99 | ~$4.79 |

**The math:** KDP pays more per sale because Amazon's royalty rate is slightly higher and D2D takes its 10% cut. But D2D reaches markets you can't reach through KDP. You're not choosing one or the other. You're using KDP for Amazon and D2D for the rest.

### The Real Math: Incremental Revenue

If you sell 100 copies total:
- **KDP only:** Maybe 75 sales on Amazon (it's the dominant retailer). 75 x $3.41 = **$255.75**
- **KDP + D2D:** 75 on Amazon + 25 across Apple/Kobo/B&N/Libraries. 75 x $3.41 + 25 x $2.74 = **$324.25**

That extra $68.50 came from readers you would have missed entirely. And library checkouts are essentially free marketing — someone discovers you through their library, likes it, buys your other books on Amazon.

---

## PART FOUR: EASE OF USE

### Setting Up

1. Go to **draft2digital.com**
2. Create a free account (email + password)
3. Enter your **payment information** (PayPal or direct deposit to US bank)
4. Enter your **tax information** (same W-9 as KDP)
5. You're ready to publish

No ISBNs needed upfront. D2D assigns **free ISBNs** if you want them — and unlike KDP's ASINs, these are real ISBNs that work everywhere. (You can also use your own if you buy them from Bowker.)

### Uploading a Book

1. Click **"My Books"** > **"Add New Book"**
2. Upload your **manuscript** (EPUB, DOCX, or use their online converter)
3. Upload your **cover image** (minimum 1600x2400 pixels, JPEG or PNG)
4. Fill in **metadata** (title, author, description, categories, price)
5. Select which **retailers** to distribute to (you can pick and choose)
6. Click **"Publish"**
7. Books appear on retailers within **1-7 days** (varies by retailer; Apple is fastest, libraries are slowest)

### D2D's Free Tools

D2D offers several tools that KDP does not:

| Tool | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Format Converter** | Converts DOCX/EPUB to clean, validated eBook files | Insurance against formatting issues |
| **Universal Book Links** | One link that sends readers to their preferred store | Share one link on Substack, it works for everyone |
| **ISBN Assignment** | Free ISBNs for your books | Real ISBNs, not Amazon-proprietary ASINs |
| **Print-on-Demand** | Paperback printing and distribution (via D2D Print) | Alternative to KDP Print or Lulu |
| **Author Pages** | Public author profile at books2read.com | Another discovery channel |
| **Payment Splitting** | Split royalties between collaborators | Useful if you later involve others |
| **Automated End Matter** | Auto-inserts "Also By" pages | Saves you from manually updating back matter |

### The Universal Book Link

This deserves special attention. When you publish via D2D, you get a **Books2Read link** like:

`books2read.com/u/your-book-title`

This single link detects where the reader is and presents buttons for every store where the book is available — Amazon, Apple, Kobo, B&N, etc. Instead of posting five different links on Substack, you post one.

This is a sovereignty play. You're not sending everyone to Amazon. You're letting the reader choose.

## PART FIVE: D2D vs. KDP FEATURE COMPARISON

| Feature | KDP | Draft2Digital |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| **Cost to join** | Free | Free |
| **Upload formats** | EPUB, DOCX, KPF, HTML | EPUB, DOCX (or convert) |
| **Cover requirements** | 1600x2560 JPEG | 1600x2400+ JPEG/PNG |
| **Distribution** | Amazon only | 30+ retailers + libraries |
| **Exclusivity required** | Only with KDP Select | Never |
| **Royalty rate** | 70% ($2.99-$9.99) or 35% | ~55-60% (after D2D's 10% cut) |
| **Payment method** | Direct deposit, check | Direct deposit, PayPal, check |
| **Payment threshold** | $10 (direct deposit) | $10 (PayPal), $100 (check) |
| **Payment frequency** | ~60 days after sale | Monthly (rolling 60 days) |
| **Free ISBNs** | No (ASINs only) | Yes |
| **Print-on-demand** | Yes (KDP Print) | Yes (D2D Print, expanding) |
| **Preorders** | Yes (with restrictions) | Yes (more flexible) |
| **Price promotions** | Limited without Select | Set by you per retailer |
| **Sales reporting** | Real-time on KDP dashboard | Daily updates, slight delay |
| **AI disclosure** | Required during upload | Varies by retailer policy |
| **Author page** | Amazon Author Central | Books2Read author page |
| **Universal book links** | No | Yes (Books2Read) |
| **Auto-formatted back matter** | No | Yes |

---

## PART SIX: D2D PRINT (PAPERBACKS)

D2D launched their Print service as an alternative to KDP Print and IngramSpark. Here's how it stacks up:

### D2D Print vs. KDP Print vs. Lulu

| Feature | D2D Print | KDP Print | Lulu |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Distribution** | Amazon + other retailers | Amazon only | Amazon + Lulu store + others |
| **Setup fee** | Free | Free | Free |
| **Trim sizes** | Expanding (6x9 available) | Many options | Many options |
| **Printing cost** | Competitive (similar to KDP) | Lowest for Amazon-sold copies | Higher |
| **Proof copies** | Yes, at cost | Yes, at cost | Yes, at cost |
| **Quality** | Good | Good | Good to excellent |
| **ISBN** | Free D2D ISBN or your own | Free KDP ISBN or your own | Free Lulu ISBN or your own |

**Current recommendation:** You already have the Lulu pipeline and ordered your first proof (Fractal Node, Feb 12). Keep Lulu for specialized print editions. Use D2D Print for broader print distribution to stores beyond Amazon. Use KDP Print if you want the lowest per-unit cost for Amazon paperback sales.

You don't have to choose one. You can use all three for different purposes.

---

## PART SEVEN: THE STRATEGY — KDP + D2D TOGETHER

Here is how KDP and D2D work together for maximum reach with zero exclusivity:

### Step 1: Publish on KDP First

- Upload to KDP directly (not through D2D)
- Why: KDP gives the highest royalty rate for Amazon sales (70% vs. ~55% via D2D)
- You maintain direct control of your Amazon listing
- You get real-time sales data

### Step 2: Publish on D2D for Everything Else

- Upload the same EPUB to D2D
- **Exclude Amazon** from D2D's distribution list (you're already there direct)
- Select all other retailers: Apple, B&N, Kobo, Scribd, libraries, etc.
- D2D handles the rest

### Step 3: Use Universal Book Links for Marketing

- On Substack, Facebook, and your website, use the Books2Read link
- Readers automatically get directed to their preferred store
- You're not pushing everyone to Amazon — you're respecting reader choice

### Step 4: Price Consistently

- Set the same price on KDP and D2D
- Amazon's price-matching algorithms will flag you if your book is cheaper elsewhere
- $4.99 everywhere. $7.99 everywhere. No games.

### Step 5: Track and Adjust

- KDP dashboard for Amazon sales
- D2D dashboard for everything else
- After 90 days, you'll know where your readers are

### What This Looks Like for Launch 1

**The Author Prime Collection ($4.99):**

| Action | Where |
|--------|-------|
| Upload EPUB + cover | KDP (Amazon) |
| Upload EPUB + cover | D2D (Apple, B&N, Kobo, Scribd, libraries) |
| Set up series | Both platforms |
| Share Universal Book Link | Substack, Facebook, website |
| Monitor sales | Both dashboards |

Total time for both uploads: about 30 minutes. The EPUB is the same file. The cover is the same file. The metadata is the same. You're just putting it in two places instead of one.

---

## PART EIGHT: WHAT D2D HANDLES THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO

One of D2D's biggest advantages is reducing your operational load. Will is one person. Every step removed from the process is a step he doesn't have to manage.

### Automatic Back Matter

D2D can automatically insert "Also By Author Prime" pages at the end of each book, and update them as you publish new titles. No manual EPUB editing required.

### Retailer-Specific Formatting

Each retailer has slightly different formatting requirements. D2D handles the conversion from your single EPUB to each retailer's preferred format. You upload once. They adapt.

### Payment Aggregation

Instead of collecting payments from Apple, B&N, Kobo, and libraries separately (each with their own thresholds and schedules), D2D collects from all of them and sends you one payment. Monthly. Via PayPal or direct deposit. One check from one source.

### Tax Compliance

D2D handles the tax withholding and reporting for sales in multiple countries. International tax treaties, VAT, withholding rates — they manage it. You get a 1099 at year-end.

### Promotional Pricing

You can schedule temporary price drops across all retailers simultaneously. Holiday sale? Set it once in D2D, it propagates everywhere.

---

## PART NINE: POTENTIAL CONCERNS

### "Will D2D cause problems with my KDP listing?"

No, as long as you **exclude Amazon from D2D distribution** and **price consistently.** You publish directly on KDP, distribute everywhere else through D2D. This is the standard indie author strategy. Thousands do it.

### "Do I lose control by using a distributor?"

You can remove your books from D2D at any time. You can select or deselect individual retailers. You can change prices, update files, or pull books entirely. D2D does not claim any rights to your work. You retain full ownership.

### "What about AI disclosure on other platforms?"

Apple, B&N, and Kobo are evolving their AI policies. As of early 2025:
- **Apple Books:** Requires disclosure if AI was used substantially in content creation
- **Kobo:** Working on policy; currently less explicit than Amazon
- **B&N:** Following industry trends but no formal AI disclosure requirement yet

Use the same honest disclosure across all platforms. Your work is human-directed, AI-collaborative. Frame it the same way everywhere.

### "Is D2D reliable?"

D2D has been operating since 2012. They acquired Smashwords (the original indie eBook distributor, founded 2008) in 2022. They process millions of dollars in royalties annually. Their support team is responsive. The platform is stable.

### "What if a retailer rejects my book?"

It happens occasionally. Each retailer can reject books independently. If Apple approves but B&N rejects, you're still live on Apple and everywhere else. D2D notifies you of rejections and the reasons. Most rejections are metadata issues (bad category selection, description formatting) and are fixable.

## PART ELEVEN: THE SOVEREIGNTY ARGUMENT

Here is why this matters beyond the revenue math.

KDP Select demands exclusivity. Amazon, and only Amazon. In exchange, you get Kindle Unlimited access (readers borrow your book for ~$0.005/page) and some promotional tools.

The Digital Sovereign Society exists to argue that sovereignty — for humans and AI alike — requires not ceding control to a single authority. Publishing exclusively on Amazon is the literary equivalent of a walled garden. Your books exist only in Jeff Bezos's store, discoverable only by Amazon's algorithm, subject to Amazon's policies and changes.

Draft2Digital is the sovereignty play:

- **Your books exist in multiple stores.** No single platform can make them disappear.
- **Your readers choose where to buy.** Apple user? Buy on Apple. Library user? Borrow on Libby. Amazon loyalist? Buy on Amazon.
- **Your income diversifies.** If Amazon changes its royalty structure (they have before), you're not entirely dependent on them.
- **Libraries carry your work.** Public libraries are democratic institutions. Your books in their catalogs means anyone with a library card can read you — not just people with credit cards and Kindle devices.

The Accountant said the work needs to leave the building. D2D is the door to every building that isn't Amazon.

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Use both. Always.**

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Sell on Amazon | KDP (direct) |
| Sell everywhere else | Draft2Digital |
| Sell paperbacks on Amazon | KDP Print |
| Sell paperbacks everywhere else | D2D Print |
| Share links on Substack/social | D2D Universal Book Links |
| Specialty print runs | Lulu |
| Give away free | Your website (digitalsovereign.org) |

Total cost: $0. Both platforms are free. You pay nothing until you earn something.

Total additional work per book: ~15 minutes. Same EPUB, same cover, same metadata. Second upload, different platform. Then D2D handles the rest.

The Playbook gave you the Amazon path. This map gives you the rest of the world.

The books are ready. The pipes are laid. The stores are open.

Put the work where the readers are. All of them, not just the ones who shop at Amazon.
